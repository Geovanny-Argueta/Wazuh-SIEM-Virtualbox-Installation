# Wazuh-SIEM-Virtualbox-Installation
Step-by-step guide to deploy a Wazuh SIEM lab on VirtualBox using multiple virtual machines to simulate real-world enterprise cyberattacks and security incidents using Wazuh SIEM.

### Step 1: Install the virtualization software
The first step is to download the virtualization software that will be used to deploy **Wazuh** and the rest of the virtual machines.
In my case, I will use **VirtualBox**, as it is a comfortable and widely used option for lab environments.
You can download VirtualBox from the official website:
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

Once on the VirtualBox website, select the **Download** option and choose the installer that matches your operating system.
In my case, I am using **Windows hosts**, so I selected the corresponding option.
